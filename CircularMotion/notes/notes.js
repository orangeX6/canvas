-> Degrees 
>> We are probably used to measure angles with degrees but knowing radians while working with js seems like a good to know

-> RADIANS 
>> Measure the openness of an angle
>> The angle made when we take the radius and wrap it round the circle
-> 1 Radian = 57.2958 degrees
-> 3.14.16... Radians = PI Radians = 180Â°

-> SINE and COSINE
>> The reason we are looking at radians is because the 2 functions we need to create circular motion, sine and cosine only takes angles in radians as their arguments.
->SINE
# Sine function that takes the openness of the angle and radians as the argument and returns to us the ratio produced if we were to draw out a triangle and divide the triangles opposite side by the triangles hypotenuse which is the longest line on a right angle triangle.
->COSINE
# Cosine will do the same thing but instead of returning the ratio of triangles opposite side, it will return the ratio of triangles adjacent side.
